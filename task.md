> I want to learn buffers and streams using deno std libraries by doing. what tasks should I do to learn effectively

Great, learning by doing is a great approach to mastering new skills. Here are some tasks you can try to learn buffers and streams using Deno's std libraries:

1. Read and write files using buffers and streams: Start with a simple task of reading a text file using a buffer and writing it to another file using a stream. Try to understand the differences between using buffers and streams, and how to use the BufReader and BufWriter classes to handle streams.

2. Transform data using a transform stream: Create a transform stream that reads data from an input stream, performs some transformation on it, and then writes the transformed data to an output stream. Try to understand the Transform class and how to use it to manipulate data.

3. Compress and decompress data using a compression stream: Use a compression stream to compress data before writing it to a file, and then use a decompression stream to decompress the data when reading it back. Try to understand the Deflate and Inflate classes and how to use them to compress and decompress data.

4. Implement a custom stream: Create a custom stream that performs some specialized functionality, such as parsing a specific data format, filtering data based on some criteria, or transforming data in a unique way. Try to understand how to create a custom stream by implementing the TransformStream interface.

5. Handle streams in real-time: Use streams to handle data in real-time, such as reading data from a network socket, processing it in real-time, and then writing it back to the socket. Try to understand the Deno.listen() function and how to use it to create a network server that handles incoming data using streams.
